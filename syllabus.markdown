# Grading  (exact grading rule subject to change by the beginning of the spring semester)
--- 

Your grade will be based on: 

* exams and quizzes (50%): pop-quizzes (5%), one midterm exam (20%) and the final (25%),  
* contributions and homeworks (40%): these include contributions to existing open source projects (details to be discussed at the
beginning of the semester)  
* participation (10%): weekly posts about contributions and activities, in class discussions and presentations
 

Grades will be determined using the following scale:

        A   95-100
        A-  90-95
        B+  87-90
        B   83-87
        B-  80-83
        C+  76-80
        C   72-76
        D   65-72
        F   less than 65


The grade of *Incomplete* is reserved for students who, for legitimate and documented reason, miss the final exam. The grade of *Incomplete* **will not be given** to student who started falling behind in class. Those students should withdraw from the class or switch to *Pass/Fail* option. 
        

# EXAMS
---
There will be a midterm and a final exam. All exams are cumulative. 

__Missing an exam:__ There will be no make-up exams. Failure to take an exam counts as a zero grade on that exam. The only exception to this rule is for students who have a legitimate medical or personal emergency (documented). These students need to talk to the instructor as soon as possible (trying to excuse an exam absence a week after it happened will not work).


# Academic Integrity Policy
--- 

I follow the department's 
[academic integrity rules](http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/academic_integrity). 

The nature of open source is based on collaborative work. But that work is still performed by individuals. 
Your name should not be associated with a contribution that is not your own or that you have not put significant amount 
of work into. 



# Academic Email Etiquette
--- 

* Check the school email address on a regular basis. You can simply forward its content 
to another email account that you use regularly.
 
* Use your school's email account to send emails to professors, instructors, TA's, graders, 
administrators, etc. OR make sure that your email address contains your true name, 
not "frabjous@gmail.com", "BabyGurl@yahoo.com" or some other cool alias. 
 
* Start your email with proper salutations! Use the correct titles (Professor, Dr., etc.) 
and spell first and last names correctly. If you are on the first name basis with your instructors, 
use their names, not "Hey". For example: "Dear Professor Drummer" or "Dear Robert", not "Hey Bob". 
 
* Sign your name under the body of your email, otherwise you expect people to read emails from anonymous.
 
* Do not write everything in upper-case letters. Do not write everything in lower-case letters.
 
* Make sure you included everything you wanted before hitting send. Don't send three emails 
one after another because you forgot something in the first one. 
 
* Proofread the text in your email before sending it. Most of the email clients check for 
typos, but they cannot tell if your email makes much sense. Read it, before you send it.
