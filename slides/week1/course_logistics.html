# Software

__Software means computer instructions or data__. Anything that can be stored electronically is software, in contrast to storage devices and display devices which are called hardware.

# This Course

The students: 

* mostly independent work (possibly in groups) of exploring and learning 

* regular class discussions (participation matters a LOT)

* regular contributions (small and large, code and not) 

<br>

The instructor:

* sets topics to be discussed (suggestions are welcome)

* coordinates the class discussion

* creates assignments 

* coordinates assessment

# Course Website

* URL: https://joannakl.github.io/cs480_s18/

    * this page contains the syllabus and daily summaries as well as loads
    of links to all other resources and services you will need for this class
    

--

* Github repository: https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18

    * One of the first assignments will involve finding problems with 
    the content of the course website, creating issues and submitting
    pull request with fixes. 
    
        (But do not start on it just yet. Wait for the details to be posted.)
    
    * During the rest of the semester you are welcome to continue
    this practice to fix minor issue and to share useful material.

# Course discussion: IRC 


IRC = Internet Relay Chat

- an essential tool used by open source software developers

- allows members of the community, or those interested in becoming involved in the community, to communicate 24/7, 
regardless of their geographic location

- IRC is much like Instant Messaging with a group

- partial IRC protocol:
    - ‘talking’ is not always a requirement; you will learn a great deal by ‘listening’, especially in the beginning; 
    - when you join a channel, it is not necessary to identify yourself or to say hi, you can simply 'lurk'; 
    - feel free to ask questions, and note that it is not necessary to ask first if you can ask a question!

# Course discussion: IRC 

course IRC channel:  	irc://freenode/ossd_s18 



IRC resources:

- [Getting started with IRC](https://opensource.com/life/16/6/irc) 

- [IRC quickstart guide](https://opensource.com/article/16/6/irc-quickstart-guide) 

- IRC cheat sheet: https://opensource.com/irc-cheat-sheet 

--

Class use: 

- we will start using IRC channel for some class communication 
    - online office hours
    - in-class "discussion"
    
- why use/learn IRC?
    - many open source projects use IRC channels for meetings and communication 
    - you need to know how to use it and how to behave in a channel in order to be part of the community
