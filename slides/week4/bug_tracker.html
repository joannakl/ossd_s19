# Bug Triage

Bug Triage (or Grooming or Gardening) is the process by which projects:
- confirm new bugs that have been submitted
    - is it a new bug report or a duplicate one 
- gather more information about the bug when necessary
- prioritize confirmed bugs
- review bugs to ensure that they are being worked on
- retire old bugs

Triaging bugs is a valuable contribution to the project.

Triaging guides:

- [Gnome - Triage Guide](https://wiki.gnome.org/Bugsquad/TriageGuide) 

- Wikimedia's [Bug management / How to triage](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Bug_management/How_to_triage) 

- Mageia [Triage guide](https://wiki.mageia.org/en/Triage_guide)

# www.codetriage.com 

The [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/) site lists hundreds of projects and their issues that need triaging.

TODO

- sign up to receive triage emails

- triage some issues

# Let's triage the issues reported for the course website

- Proper way of marking duplicates:

    Duplicate of #5 
 
    (where #5 is the number of original bug) 

- Don't close issues without explaining why they can be (or should be) closed 

- Be careful when using # - #6 becomes a link to the issue #6 (this makes little sense when you are talking abut Class #6) 

- Remember to use markdown formatting [link](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
